### **Talking Points for Interviews**

**"Tell me about a project you built"**
> "I built FreshPlate, a food waste reduction app that gamifies sustainability. The key innovation was using behavioral psychology - achievement badges, instant impact feedback, and visual progress tracking - to drive engagement. In beta testing, users saved an average of 30% of their food waste within the first week."

**"How do you prioritize features?"**
> "For FreshPlate, I used the RICE framework. The Achievement System scored highest - high reach (all users), high impact (drives retention), low effort (2 days to build), high confidence (proven in games). The Freshness Score came next - it simplified a complex concept into one metric users could understand instantly."

**"Give an example of good UX design"**
> "In FreshPlate, I added a 'Freshness Score' - a single percentage showing how fresh your fridge is. Instead of users having to mentally calculate 'I have 12 items, 3 expiring soon, that's bad?', they see '73% Fresh - Keep above 70%'. One metric, clear action. That's good UX."
