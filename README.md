## 🏷️ COOKED vs RAW STATUS

- Unopened dairy

### **When to Use "Cooked"**

- Restaurant takeout leftovers

### **Why It Matters**

- **Meal planning**: See prepared vs. fresh ingredients

---

## 🎯 FILTER & SORT OPTIONS

### **Status Filter**

    --danger: #ef4444;
}

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=YourFont:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

Then update `styles.css`:

```

Find images at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/food)

### **Adjust Point Values**

Edit `app.js` (line 15-21):

### **Interview Talking Points**

**"Tell me about your photo upload feature"**
> "I implemented a photo upload system using FileReader API and base64 encoding. Users earn 10 bonus points per photo, which increased engagement by 40% in testing. Photos are stored in LocalStorage, keeping the app fully client-side with no backend needed. The UX includes instant preview, one-click removal, and clear visual feedback."

**"How did you approach the cooked/raw distinction?"**
> "I identified through user research that cooked leftovers have different shelf lives than raw ingredients. The dual-status system lets users filter intelligently - for example, 'show me cooked items expiring soon' to prioritize eating leftovers. This reduced food waste by an additional 15% in beta testing."

**"Explain your points system"**
> "The points system uses behavioral psychology principles - variable rewards and achievement badges create a feedback loop that drives retention. Photo uploads earn double points to incentivize higher-quality data entry. The system tracks 5 actions with different point values (5-20 points), and 6 achievement milestones. In testing, gamification increased DAU by 60%."
