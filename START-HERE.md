1. Put both files in a folder
2. Double-click **index.html**

## 🐛 IF IT DOESN'T WORK

### **Test Locally First:**
1. Download both files
2. Put in same folder
3. Double-click index.html
4. Opens in browser?
5. Looks good?

**If YES:**
- Problem is with GitHub upload
- Make sure files uploaded correctly
- Wait 2 minutes for GitHub Pages

**If NO:**
- Send me screenshot of what you see
- Check browser console (F12 → Console)
- Try different browser

- Conflicting styles
- Complex file structure

**This version has:**
- Everything in ONE file
- No file loading to fail
- Simple, tested code
- Works everywhere

## 📸 WHAT TO SEND IF STUCK

If doesn't work after uploading:

1. **Screenshot of local version** (index.html opened on your computer)
2. **Screenshot of GitHub repo** (showing 2 files uploaded)
3. **Screenshot of live site** (what you see at your URL)
4. **Browser console** (F12 → Console tab with any errors)
